This repository showcases a common C programming error involving pointer manipulation. The `bug.c` file contains code that incorrectly handles pointer assignment, leading to undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.c` file provides a corrected version that avoids this issue and demonstrates the proper way to use pointers in C.  The key learning point is to ensure pointers are always assigned to valid memory locations and used correctly.
